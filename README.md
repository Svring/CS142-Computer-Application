# CS142-Computer-Application
Stanford cs142 course, designed with html, css, js, react, node, express, mongodb and many other techs.

This repo includes project1-7 of cs142, however this course is still using class component(2023 at this time), which has been replaced by function components in the last few years, 
thus making it no more a great choice for beginners.
For anyone who is willing to learn react in 2023, I recommend _The Road To React_ of ROBIN WIERUCH.

I also create a new branch called _Improved_ and add my improved version of cs142 project to it, the folder name is _project7_improved_, in this version I completely replaced
original class component with function component, use it as reference if you'd like to compare the difference between two components.
